# TeenyTinyExplorer

Teeny Tiny Explorers is a web application that was designed to serve as a way for parents and caregivers of young children to find local nature based playgroups. 

**Problem Description**
Parents and caregivers with children who enjoy spending time outdoors and connecting with others in their community need a solution that will search for local groups focused on spending time outdoors and decreasing screentime. Teeny Tiny Explorers was created to be used as a source to connect like-minded people wanting to have local outdoor playgroups more easily. The web application also allows users to search for upcoming events in their area and local recurring playgroups. Users may also request to become hosts, and the hosts run the meetups and events to ensure organization. The hosts utilize the administrative features in Teeny Tiny Explorers to keep track of meetings, groups, events, and members.  

**Minimal Viable Product**
A high-level overview of the necessary features for a minimal viable product includes features that allow users to search, create, update, and delete groups and events on the web application. Users need to create a new account, login to their account, submit a form to become a host if they desire, and sign up for upcoming events.  A high-level overview of the necessary features for non-host users includes searching for local groups and events, registering for events, creating a user profile, submitting questions, requesting to become a host. Host users will have additional necessary features for administrative purposes such as creating, updating, and deleting groups and events. A host also needs to have the ability to add, delete, or edit member lists. Those seeking to find local groups will interact with the web application and primarily use the features to search for local groups and upcoming events. Individuals who want to host local Teeny Tiny Explorers affiliated groups would do so by submitting a request on the site. They will utilize the admin dashboards to keep track of groups, group members, and important updates when they are hosts.  

**Design**
The design of Teeny Tiny Explorers is a three-tier stack pattern that will include html/cass, node.js, and MySQL.

Teeny Tiny Explorers utilizes relational database structure due to the data that is needed for the MVP (minimal viable product).
